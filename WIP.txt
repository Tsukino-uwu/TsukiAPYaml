          # some questions i had during the hours it took to me get triggers to work together/properly
          # tl;dr: top to bottom activation order, and ofc indents as always
          # answer: trigger1 picks an option to early, trigger2 ignore/overwrite as it will happen after trigger1 already did its thing
          #
          # can I have multiple option results in a trigger ?, can the result be another option name  ? :thinking: 
          # or is there someway for a trigger to just inherit results from another trigger ?
          # possible to make a trigger where if its true/false allows for different weights in normal options to trigger or not ?
          # make a trigger affect what optiosn get picked somewhere else but not those options weight ?
          # For triggers "If you would like the same thing to occur with multiple results, you would need multiple triggers for this."
          # is it possible to grab previous results from other triggers instead of forcing true/false ? think triggers kinda overwrite each other right ?

  # its possible to use weights, and get a 2 true statement = do X thing, with just 1 option_result:
  # example: 
          
  # triggers:
    # - option_category: Factorio
      # option_name: difficulty
      # option_result: hard
      # options:

            # logistic: 50
            # military: 50
            # automation_with_hard_difficulty: 50
    # - option_category: Factorio
      # option_name: maximum_science_pack
      # option_result: automation_with_hard_difficulty
      # options:
        # Factorio:
          # satelite: hard
          # maximum_science_pack: automation
          
  # here "satelite" is set to "vanilla" if "difficulty" is "hard" and "maximum_science_pack" is "automation"
